# BCGx - Data Science Virtual Internship Program

This repository contains the tasks and projects I have completed as part of the Data Science Virtual Internship Program offered by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) through Forage. This program was divided into 4 tasks, each of which was designed to give me a taste of the kind of work that BCG's data scientists do on a daily basis. The tasks were as follows:

1. **Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing**
2. **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modeling**
4. **Task 4: Findings & Recommendations**

## Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing

In this task, I focused on understanding the business problem faced by PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility. I identified the key business objectives and framed hypotheses that could explain the customer churn issue. I also determined the necessary data required for analysis and outlined the techniques to be used for investigating the problem. Finally, I drafted an email to the Associate Director summarizing my approach and the initial steps to be taken.

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modeling

## Task 4: Findings & Recommendations
